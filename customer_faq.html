                <h3>Q: We are a small startup with only a few persons. Do we need to hire a Quality Manager?</h3>
<p>
                A: Quality Manager can either be someone’s side responsibility or you can hire a consultant on
                hourly basis. Depending on your own capaciaty, during build of a quality system´the consultants
                assignment can be 2-3 days per week. When the operations get stabilized, it can be reduced to one day
                weekly or biweekly.</p>

        <div id="content2"> 
            <h3>Q: What kind of competence is required to be a Quality Manager?</h3>
            <p>
                A: With ISO 9001, there is no legal requirement. Understanding the business and products is the most
                important criterion. But in regulated businesses, like medical devices, the Quality Manager - then called
                Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (PRRC) - needs to have both basic education and certain amount of
                relevant experience.

         <div id="content3"> 
            <h3>Q: What kind of language should we use for audit?</h3>
                <p>A: There is no legal requirement to use a certain amount of four-syllable words. On the contrary,
                quality system documentation shall be written in a language which is easily uderstood by the people
                reading it. However, if you plan to get your managment system certified, somebody needs to ”translate”
                during the building of the quality management system the ”bureucratic standard language” to the
                layman’s.
